//Views are typically refer to the presentation layer in the context of web development.
// Views are responsible for rendering the user interface and displaying data to the user.
// They are often associated with a specific template or user interface component and
// may contain both data and presentation logic.

//In some cases, a combination of DTOs and views may be appropriate.
// For instance, you can use DTOs to transfer data between layers,
// and then use views to render that data within the presentation layer.
